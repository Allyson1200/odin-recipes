hello my name is Allyson and I will be introducing the current project I am working on at the moment. I am currentyl working on the project called 
odin recipes what I basically have to do is 
think of 3 foods of ur choice and right the steps on how to make that food.
I think this project will be fun and a great way to learn to make those foods.
